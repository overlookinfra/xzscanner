# Mirrored repository

This repository is synced from upstream on a regular basis.
This default `plumbing` branch contains only the code to run the sync and this `README`.

The other branches hold the actual code, and regular snapshots are taken and stored in the `backup/*` path.

Change to the `main` or `master` branch to see the repo you probably expected.
